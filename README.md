## Summary

Comparing temperature data for June and December show only a small amount variation between the two months. Temperatures are warm in both months, with December daily averages only slightly lower than June's. These temperature trends suggest that it would be viable to operate the surf and ice cream shop on a year-round basis.

Further analysis might compare the average rainfall for June and December to create a more complete picture of weather conditions. A preliminary comparison of precipitation for the two months shows that December gets significantly more rain than June.  The following two tables compare daily precipitation for June and December:

While the temperature trends suggest that the business could be sustainable throughout the year, incorporating precipitation data complicates the picture. The cooler, rainier weather in December suggests less demand for ice cream and surfing gear in the winter months.
